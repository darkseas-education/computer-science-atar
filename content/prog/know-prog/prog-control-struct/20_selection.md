# Selection

Selection means choosing between actions based upon some condition.

A *condition* is an expression that evaluates to True or False.
Is it raining?
Or, is your age above 18 years?

## Relevance

We will often need our software to have different outcomes based upon different
conditions.
For that we will need branching code.

## Theory

There are other forms of selection than `if` statements in Python, but you will
not be required to demonstrate them for your ATAR exams.

The scope of names and functions can be used to cause branching in code (dispatch), as can
the selection of which object or methods to call in Object-Oriented Programming.
Keys in a dictionary can also cause branching of code and outcomes.
