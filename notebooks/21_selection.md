# Selection Notebook

The most common form of selection in Python is the `if` .. `else` statement.



```python
age = 21
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote.")
else:
    print("You will have to wait to have your say.")
```

An even simpler statement is the single branch `if`


```python
temp = -4

print("Going for a walk.")
if temp < 2:
    print("Watch out for ice!")
```


```python

```
