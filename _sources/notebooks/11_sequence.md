# Sequence Notebook

Doing things in order.

Have a look at the three code cells below.

We usually run a notebook cell-by-cell from top to bottom with the play icon or keys Shift-Enter.

What will happen if you tun the cell beginning `print('Welcome ...')`


```python
print("Welcome to Hogwarts, ", student_name)
```


```python
student_name = "Apprentice " + name
```


```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
```

You can reorder the cells by clicking the up and down arrows.

You will find them on the right margin of the cell. ---->


```python

```
