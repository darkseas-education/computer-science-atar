# Sequence

In Python, sequence matters.
In most programming languages, (though not all), the order that values, functions and classes are defined is important.

## Overview

Sequence is a programming structure that determines whether your program will run, and whether it will work as expected.

### Real world relevance

Understanding sequence is critical to a vast majority of situations in life.
Start painting at the door, and soon you will be stuck in a corner.

## Theory

The Python interpreter will read and execute your scripts and modules, line by line, from the top down.

## Practical

When you get sequence wrong, you will receive a NameError (hopefully).
